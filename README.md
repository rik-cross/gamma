### Changelog

|Version|Description|
|---|---|
|0.1|Initial engine version. Includes a basic ECS implementation, scenes (and transitions) and some UI elements. There are very basic versions of a number of systems.|
|0.2|Some improvements to the systems, mainly adding optional parameters to allow customisation.|
|0.3|More improvements to the systems, including the addition of a renderer for each scene. This takes the drawing away from the camera system, and allows for the addition of custom systems that can draw.|
|0.4|The addition of a 'collect the coins' example, showing how to create a very simple but complete game. This coincides with the creation of an initial video tutorial series. There are also other various edits and improvements.|
